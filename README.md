# Typescript - Invoices

This project run a simple index.html file with minimal assets like css or javascript. You can just open that file but I highly recommend you to setup a proper environment . <br /> <br /> 

In my case for this project I've used IDE [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with 'Live Server' extension.<br />
If you want to modify source code for this project, typescript needs be installed globaly on your machine with [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en). Version used for this project 20.17.0 LTS. <br /> <br />
